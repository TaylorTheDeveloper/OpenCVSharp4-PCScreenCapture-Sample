# OpenCVSharp4-PCScreenCapture-Sample
Example using OpenCVSharp4 to read input from your PC monitor as a screen capture, instead of a video file or camera capture. You can then do any sort of image processing on the stream that you want. This sample follows the same pattern as [OpenCVSharp4 Samples](https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp_samples/tree/6f36757252ac80310bcb39b9e607720317cc740c) and uses [OpenCVSharp4](https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp). This sample also leverages source code shared by [Cody Popham on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39760371/can-i-screenshot-or-printscreen-with-a-console-application-without-excess-refere) for the PrintScreen class functionality.
